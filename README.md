# AED Optimization Project for Modern Data Analytics Course
## Group China
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using intervention, hospital and AED information. We visualized the survival information with relation to locations of AEDs and hospitals, and enabled users to interactively add new AED for location optimization.
