# AED Optimization Project for Modern Data Analytics Course
## Introduction
In this project, a machine learning model was built to predict survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using intervention, hospital and AED information. Additionally, a web application was developed via Dash and Plotly to visualize the survival information with relation to locations of AEDs and hospitals, and to enable users to interactively add new AEDs to explore AED optimization possibilities.
## Usage
