# AED Optimization Project for Modern Data Analytics Course
## Introduction
In this project, we first built a machine learning model to predict survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using intervention, hospital and AED information. We then developed a web application via Dash and Plotly to visualize the survival information with relation to locations of AEDs and hospitals, and enabled users to interactively add new AED for location optimization.
